HW 1 Problem 1:
Create a data frame comprised of:

a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution,
a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0,
a character vector of length 8, and
a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”
```{r create_df}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1234)
df_problem1 = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  log_vec = norm_samp > 0,
  char_vec = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "January", "February", "March"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("day","week","month","day","week","month","day","week"))
)
```
