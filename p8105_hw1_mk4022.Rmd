```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Create a data frame comprised of:

a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
a character vector of length 8
a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”
Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesn’t?
